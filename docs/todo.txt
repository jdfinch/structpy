FILE PARSING
    Approach:
        1. Write grammar (mimics form of actual sequence to parse)
        2. Convert grammar to DFA (detect parsing ambiguities)
        3. DFA is extended to save certain sequences to variables
        4. Store variables in abstract syntax tree (parent is production rule)
    Dependencies:
        1. Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

DETERMINISTIC FINITE AUTOMATA
    Approach:
        1. Directed graph extended to include a state node
        2. Implement with a Node-based graph structure for efficiency
    Dependencies:
        1. Node-based graph

DEFAULT AND IMPLEMENTATION STRUCTURE SETTINGS
    Motivation:
        Most use cases of a data structure are either "typical" use cases
        where a single implementation is best, or are not performance
        sensitive at all.
    Approach:
